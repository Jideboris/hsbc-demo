# hsbc-demo

The code was written using React frontend and Node backend. I prepared a scaffolding to implement the backend with Java 17+ but could not complete OR test it due issues on my laptop that required time to fix related to JAVA SDK installation, hence I completed the task by using Node.

The code can be cloned down from git here
git@github.com:Jideboris/hsbc-demo.git
OR https://github.com/Jideboris/hsbc-demo.git

Frontend
cd to hsbc-demo
npm i
npm run dev
Browser here: http://localhost:5173/

Server
cd hsbc-demo
cd node-server
node index.js OR node index
You should see 'Server running at http://localhost:3000' 

Note: the frontend is proxy to server using vite.config.js.
